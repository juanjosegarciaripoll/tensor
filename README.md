# Tensor

Tensor is a C++ library for numerical arrays and tensor objects and operations with them, designed to allow Matlab-style programming. Some of the key features:

1. Fundamental data structures
  - Arrays of indices
  - Multidimensional arrays of double precision, real and complex numbers
  - Sparse matrices of real and complex numbers

2. Operations
  - Algebraic operations between tensors, matrices and numbers.
  - Contraction among tensors (a generalization of matrix multiplication).
  - Tensor reshaping, index permutation, enlarging and contracting.

3. Linear algebra
  - Solving systems of linear equations
  - Matrix exponentiation
  - Eigenvalue problems
  - Few eigenvalues of sparse problems using Arpack
  - Singular value decompositions

4. Fast Fourier Transforms

Full library documentation, including the API reference, and instructions for [installing](http://tensor.garciaripoll.com/html/installation.html) and [using](http://tensor.garciaripoll.com/html/usage.html) the library, is available at <https://tensor.garciaripoll.com>.

The Tensor library is discussed in the [libtensor Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/libtensor). Go to this forum for help in configuring and installing the library.

Bug reports should be submitted using the GitHub Issues interface, although limited support could be provided via the group.
