/*!\mainpage Tensor Library Documentation

Tensor is a tensor algebra library for doing numerics with arrays of real and
complex numbers, typically floating point ones. The main motivation of the
library is to provide arrays with more than one or two indices, and allow the
kind of computations that are easily done with Matlab, Yorick or Scilab, to
name some popular software.
